<p><h1><B>Orchestral Playing</b></h1></p>
<p>
The harp is a challenging instrument to play with an Orchestra, partly due to there only usually being one or two players so there is very little room for error and also due to having to compete with a large groups of other instrumentalists.

In 2011 she also played harp with the Hallé Youth Orchestra on their summer tour of Cornwall.
