      <h3>Harp Teaching</h3>
      <p>
      Jessica’s teaching experience ranges from private one-to-one tuition to group tuition within schools and even whole class instrument teaching. She will tailor the teaching style to whatever is appropriate for each individual’s learning pattern and also musical preferences. She tries to encourage pupils with performance and taking grades, however this is by no means obligatory and plenty of individuals play just for pleasure!
