I currently teach Harp and Violin and am looking to take on more pupils. I also teach within schools and take group lessons. I have taught piano privately in the past and would be prepared to take on beginners and have accompanied choirs and instrumental ensembles. I have completed a music bachelors degree at Cardiff University and gained a 2:1.
I am an experienced harpist and play at events such as weddings, funerals, social and business events.">
